Parking Simulation

Theoretical simulation for learning of parking (such as parallel or perpendicular parking)

Implemented by R with grid graphics system

### Prerequisite

R and R package {grid}

### Usage

Just load and run parking_simulation.20220109.r in R by
```source("parking_simulation.20220109.r")```.

You may manually change the code ```simulation_option = 1``` to ```simulation_option = 2``` for perpendicular parking instead of parallel parking.

Or you may also manually execute ```restart_simulation()``` with different parameters, or even manually change the initial setting in the code of ```restart_simulation()``` (before and defining redraw), for example, change colors, if you like.
